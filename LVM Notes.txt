LVM Concept
-----------

1) Before you start, you need to check for block devices that can be used to create physical volumes
  
   sudo lvmdiskscan

2) Create physical volume using 
  
   sudo pvcreate /dev/sda     (here "/dev/sda" is disk space you can get this details when u type "lsblk" or df -h or df --o)

3) Create volume group using 
  
   sudo vgcreate vgdata /dev/sda ( here "vgdata" is name for volume group and "/dev/sda" same as before i explained )

4) Create logical volume using 
   
   sudo lvcreate -n lvdata -L +3G  vgdata ( Here "lvdata" is the name of logical volume and "+3G" is the storage allocated for logical volume )

5) Making file system formate

   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vgData/lvdata ( /dev/volumegroupname/logicalvolumegroupname )

6) Creating directory using mkdir for logicalvolume
  
   mkdir /lvg  ( Here lvg is just directory to mount that lvdata )

7) Mounting this directory to lvdata
  
   mount /dev/vgdata/lvdata /lvg

8) To make it permanent on system boot, add the following entry to /etc/fstab

   /dev/vgData/lvdata /mnt/lvdata ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0    

9) In order to extend an existing VG with additional disks, you need to do the following (assuming sdc is the new disk)
